# FundAppsRoverAssignment

This little testing program was made for FundApps and will show my mindset in programming TDD style!

## Small introduction to the app
The assignment was to make a moving "Rover" on a grid of 100x100, the Rover can find obstacles on it's path and can't fly outside of the Grid.

I chose Python and PythonUnitTesting respectively for making this assignment, as for the reason I chose Python, I never used it in a TDD scenario, so I just gave it a shot! 

## My Mindset per test

I began the assignment by defining little test for myself (on paper) to just get a feeling of how I wanted to tackle the problems. Since it was my first time using Unit Tests in Python it was also a bit of an introduction phase to getting me up to full speed :).

The first three tests are really simple and go into the movement and starting to get a feeling about the border of the Rover. 
The differces between test cycle 1 and 3 are minimal since I just started adding if-statements describing different motions of the Rover. 

In Test 4 things got a little bit out of hand pace wise. Since I just started looking at every command all at once, since I didn't see the full value in making a new test iteration for every single commmand at that point.

Iteration Test 5 became the first test that made me think for a little bit, since I want to show my mindset in tackling issues, I left both the working as well as a randomized obstacle maker which worked, but wasn't really convienant testing wise. 

The last test I did was adding border detection on all borders (instead of just one in test 3).

everything code-explaining related is commented in the python project :)

## What would I change in the future?

If I had more time to work on this project I would find a better way of handling the movement of the Rover, now I just used if/elif/else statements that work, but I just feel like I can improve on that way more then I did now. 

And I would (of course) finish my randomized obstacle creator just for fun!

I hope this assignment gave a good impression about my way of programming.
